<h1>Brain Tumor Detection</h1>
<p>
  This model is trained on kaggle brain tumor dataset.
  It is trained in two ways:
          <b>1. Using Custom Neural Network (v1)</b>
          <b>2. Using Transfer Learning(v2,v3,v4,v5,my_model)</b>
  During the process data got resizied, rescaled and augmented.
  The following are the stats :
